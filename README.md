sample-topologies
=================

sample topologies that run on VIRL.

Note - this can be access directly using the Git functionality available in VM Maestro. To do this:

In VM Maestro, select 'File/import/Git/Projects from Git/Clone URI'

The URI is then:

https://github.com/VIRL-Open/sample-topologies

This is an open repo but if you want to include your username and password for GitHub, you can under 'Authentication'

Now select ‘master’

You’ll then be asked to identify a local location (on your laptop) where the files can then be stored. This must be an empty directory. Then press ‘next’. Press ‘next’ once more to import as a ‘general project’.

You can then give the project (folder) a name and press Finish.

You should then see the files and folder show up in the Projects tab.

You can then make changes to your local copy and when ready to ‘commit’, select the file, or the project (if you want to commit multiple files), right-mouse, Team/Commit and follow the dialog to commit and push changes to the repo.
